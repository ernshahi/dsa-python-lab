# Stack
The stack data structure is a collection of elements that follows the Last-In, First-Out(LIFO) principle. which means the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed.


## Terminology
- pushed: adding an element to the top of the stack
- popped: removing the top element from the stack
- top: the top element of the stack
- peek: the top element of the stack
- isEmpty: check if the stack is empty
- size: the number of elements in the stack
